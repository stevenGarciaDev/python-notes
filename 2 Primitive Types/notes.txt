Variables

  core concept,

  use it to store data in
  a computer's memory

  students_count = 1000
  print(students_count)

  4.99 # float

  True || False

  course_name = "Python Programming"


Variable names

  you want your code to read
  like a story,

  should be easy to read

strings

  message = """
  This is a long
  message defined
  over multiple lines
  """

  some useful things with strings

  have built in functions
  for getting the length

  len(course)
  // so we call that function

  print(course[-1])
  // returns the first character
  // from the end of the string

  print(course[0:3])
  // return a new string
  // arg 1 -> first index
  // arg 2 -> last index (exclusive)

  course[:3]

  course[:]
  // return a copy of the original string


escape sequences

  course = "Python \"Programming\""

  or could use single quotes



formatted strings

  can use concatenation

  but modern approach is formatted strings

  first = "Steven"
  last = "Garcia"
  full = f"{first} {last}"

  you can put any expression within
  { }


string methods

  have many methods available
  for strings

  an autocompletion tool would
  be helpful

  everything in Python
  is an object

  course_capital = course.upper()

  course.lower()
  course.title()
  // capitalize first letter of every word

  course.strip() // trim white space for user input

  course.lstrip()
  course.rstrip()


  course.find("pro")
  // will return the index

  course.replace("p", "j")

  print("pro" in course)
  // this checks if pro is in course
  // the find() method returns
  // an index
  // whereas this expression
  // returns boolean

  print("swift" not in course)


numbers

  3 types of Numbers

  integers, floats, and complex numbers for math

  // such as
  // a + bi where i is an imaginary number
  // this is for mathematics
  // and electrical engineering
  // use j in place of i

  x = 1 + 2j

  have a special operator
  augmented assignment operator

  x = 10
  x += 3


working with Numbers

  print(round(2.9))

  abs(-2.9)
  // returns 2.9

  if writing complex mathematical
  calculation need to
  use the Math module

  import math

  // math will have many methods
  print( math.ceil(2.2) )
  // returns 3,
  // so it rounds up


type conversion

  a useful built in function

  # get input from user
  # arg is the prompt
  x = input("x: ")

  # not that input is always read
  # as a string

  # so need to cast
  we have int(x)
  float(x)
  bool(x)
  str(x)

  print(type(x))
  num = int(x)
  y = num + 1

  # Falsy
  # ""
  # 0
  # None
