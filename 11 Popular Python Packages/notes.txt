introduction

What are APIs?

	Websites make their
	data available through APIs

	These are publically accessible
	endpoints,
	which have urls
	just like a website.

	// publically available
	// on internet


	so can send an HTTP request
	to the endpoint
	to retrieve data

	HTTP is the protocol
	that powers the web

	browser sends HTTP request
	to web servers and
	gets a response

	open up developer tools,
	Network tab,

	refresh the page,
	it'll show all the
	HTTP request


	status code
	200 indicates success

	look at response tab,

	will see the response
	that web server
	sent to our browser,

	// it's essentially
	// a preview for the webpage
