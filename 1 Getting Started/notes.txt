What is Python

  used for Software Engineers
  as well as data analyst,
  scientist, accountants,
  network engineers, mathematicians, ect

  has a clean syntax,

  solve complex problems in less
  time with fewer lines of code

  // in JS
  str.substr(0, 3);

  // in Python
  str[0:3]

  Python is multi-purpose

  can do a lot such as

  - data analysis
  - AI/ML
  - automation scripts
  - web apps
  - mobile apps
  - desktop apps
  - software testing
  - hacking

  high paying,
  average is $115,000

  Python is a high level language

  - high-level (abstraction)
    // don't deal with memory
  - cross-platform
  - huge community
  - large ecosystem of open source

  Python 2 will stop being
  supported in 2020
  // legacy

  Python 3
  // future


installing Python

  from python.org

  downloads

  click on checkbox,
  'add Python to PATH'

  on windows

  cmd in search bar

  in there

  > python

  // to exit
  control + z + enter

  --

  on Mac

  in terminal

  $ python

  // Mac and Linux come with Python 2
  // installed

  so exit
  with control + d + enter

  $ python3

Python Interpreter

  $ python3

  // this opens up the
  // python Interpreter

  // it's a program that executes
  // Python code

  so can write an expression
  // expression is some code
  // that returns/results some value

  boolean values of
  True
  False

  will also display syntax errors




Code Editors

  with Python, have two options

  use an Editor
  or
  an IDE

  IDE's provide
    - autocompletion
    - debugging
    - testing

  most popular editor is
  VSCode
  Atom
  Sublime

  IDE
  is PyCharm


Your first Python Program

  $ mkdir HelloWorld

  $ touch app.py

  call the function

  print("Hello")

  in VSCode

  have an integrated terminal

  keyboard shortcut
  is

  ctrl + `

  $ python3 app.py

  --

  print("Testing")
  print("*" * 10)

Python Extension

  convert VScode into a powerful
  IDE
  using extension, 'python'

  get some features such as
    - Linting
    - autocompletion
    - unit testing
    - debugging
    - code formatting
    - code snippets

  linter pylint
  // needs to be installed

  it's a tool that analyzes code
  and finds potential problems

  select python3

  .....


Linting Python Code

  once installed

  write some invalid python

  print "testing"

  // hover over with mouse

  -

  now for some shortcuts,

  View tab,
  Problems
  // for Mac
  // shift + cmd + m

  command pallette

  pylint is most popular

  the lints differ in how
  they find and report errors

  some error messages
  are more friendly

Formatting Python Code

  have a bunch of documents called

  'Python Enhancement Proposals'
  // peps

  it'll automatically format
  your code


Python Implementations

  to run this Python

  $ python3 app.py

  you can install code runner,
  so instead of manually
  executing in terminal

  all you have to do is
  ctrl + alt + n


  in User settings

  cpython is the default
  implementation of python,

  other ones include

  cPython / default
  Jython // Java
  IronPython // C#
  PyPy  // subset of Python

  variety
  based on disagreements

  one technical reason behind it

  allows you to reuse existing
  code in the program,
  based on the core language
  of the Python implementation


How Python Code is Executed

  machine code is based on the
  processor of the computer

  windows and mac have different
  machine code

  Java solves this by compiling
  it into Java Bytecode
  // run it on a Java Virtual Machine
  // which converts to machine code

  Python results in Python Bytecode
